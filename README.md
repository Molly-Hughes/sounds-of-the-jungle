**Sounds of the Jungle** is an interactive sound game for children. Pressing keys plays jungle animal sounds. Designed with a jungle theme and bright, friendly visuals, it's a simple way for children to associate letters with animal noisesâ€”perfect for learning and playing!

## How It Works

Each key on the keyboard is mapped to a jungle animal. When a child presses a key, they'll:

- See the button animate.
- Hear the corresponding animal sound (e.g., E = Elephant).

This game uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - no frameworks or libraries are required.

## Animals and Key Mapping

| Key |  Animal  |  Sound  |
| --- | :------: | :-----: |
| E   | Elephant | Trumpet |
| F   |   Frog   | Ribbit  |
| L   |   Lion   |  Roar   |
| M   |  Monkey  | Chatter |
| S   |  Snake   |  Hiss   |

A looping jungle ambient soundtrack plays softly in the background to create an immersive experience.
